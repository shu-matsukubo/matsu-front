# matsu Front

React + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the matsu workspace.

The frontend talks to `matsu-bff` instead of calling the Laravel API or auth server directly. Browser authentication is handled through an HttpOnly session cookie owned by the BFF.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TanStack Query
- Axios
- Zod
- lucide-react

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server is usually available at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Environment

The BFF base URL defaults to:

```text
http://localhost:18082
```

Set `VITE_BFF_BASE_URL` if a different BFF origin is needed.

API requests use the BFF `/api/*` proxy. The frontend must not store access or refresh tokens in localStorage.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite dev server. |
| `npm run build` | Run TypeScript build checks and create the production Vite build. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint with zero warnings allowed. |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Auto-fix ESLint issues where possible. |
